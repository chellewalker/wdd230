		<h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Google Chrome</p>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/">google.com/chrome/downloads/</a>
        <p></p>
        <img src="images/visual-hierarchy.png" alt="Visual Hierarchy">
        <p>Visual Hierarchy is a design process that attempts to organize its information by the importance of the content. 
            For example, the webpage for Google Chrome opens prominently to a download link, the most important element as 
            it actually provides the service, before then having details on the program as a user scrolls further and further.

		<h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <p>Microsoft Outlook</p>
        <a href="https://outlook.office.com/mail/">outlook.office.com/mail/</a>
        <p></p>
        <img src="images/rule-of-thirds.png" alt="Rule of Thirds">
        <p>The Rules of Thirds is a type of composition in which the primary section is contained 
            within the furthest left or right third of the page, creating a more open design. 
            As an example, Microsoft Outlook contains its navigation and lists of the right third 
            of the screen, leaving the remaining space to display selected emails without intruding 
            on the navigational space.

		<h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
        <p>Reddit</p>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit.com/</a>
        <p></p>
        <img src="images/parc-repetition.png" alt="PARC: Repetition">
        <p>The Repition principle of PARC states that repeated use of layouts, colors, and even fonts help 
            to orientate the user and emphasizing important details of the website through 
            reappearing elements to create a degree of familiarity. A good example of this principle 
            can be found in most social media websites, such as Reddit, which use a standardized format to 
            display individual posts to naturally draw a user's eyes to the new post.
